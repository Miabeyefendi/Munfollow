## ⚡ Why Munfollow?

Most Instagram bots get you banned. **Munfollow is different.**
It mimics human behavior with randomized delays, safety pauses, and intelligent scanning. It runs locally on your browser—no passwords shared, no suspicious API calls.

### 🚀 Key Features

*   **🛡️ Advanced Anti-Ban System:** Configurable min/max delays and auto-pause mechanisms to keep your account safe.
*   **🎯 Smart Filtering:** 
    *   Filter by **Non-Followers** (Those who don't follow you back).
    *   Filter by **Mutuals**, **Verified Accounts**, or **Private Accounts**.
    *   Filter by **No Profile Picture** (Ghost followers).
*   **🌍 Multi-Language Support:** English 🇬🇧, Turkish 🇹🇷, Spanish 🇪🇸.
*   **📊 Real-Time Statistics:** Watch the process live with a modern UI overlay.
*   **⚡ No Installation:** Works directly in Google Chrome / Edge / Firefox console.
